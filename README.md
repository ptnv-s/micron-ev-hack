# Micron Hackathon
## Problem Statement :

Optimal Deployment of Electric Vehicles & Charging Stations

## Objective:

Design an algorithm which will tell you where to deploy charging stations in a city. Some examples of inputs to your algorithm will be traffic on that route, connectivity of the route (inner city v/s highway), presence of other charging stations nearby, installation of types of charging station (fast v/s battery swapping v/s â€¦) etc 

## File Structure:
1. app_dir - contains code for the deployed application
2. data_extraction - contains script for data extraction
3. ml_models - contains logic for the algorithms and models used 

## Tech Stack:
### Front-End:
HTML
CSS
Bootstrap

### Back-End: 
Flask
### Data Engineering/ Scraping:

### ML-Models/Miscellenaeous : 
Folium
Numpy
